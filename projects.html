                <p>A compilation of things I've built and done over the years. I definitely learned a lot from them, and I hope you can share in that knowledge as well! Feel free to contact me with any questions about any of these, I would love to give more detailed explanationions or share plans :)</p>
                <p>Unless otherwise specified (or unclickable), each project links to a report, or sub-page with more info. Bon Appetit! <i>Note: I'm still building the site, so many of the detail pages won't exist yet (as of 8.08.2012).</i></p>

			<p>That means I got to play around with solar panels, charging circuits, touch-sensitive controls, audio amplifiers, and putting and wiring and testing everything together - for a near-zero budget :). </p>
			<p>The best part? It could fill a warehouse full of dubstep for 6 hours - longer, if the solar panels were charging. Probably the most complete A->B and thorough project I have ever done</p>

			<p>For a humanities project that bridged the fields of writing, psychology, anthropology, and education research, I wrote a short book that is a collection of people's life stories and core life philosophies: who they are and how they came to be that way - and what we can learn from them.</p>	
			<p>This version has two interviews included in it, as well as some thoughts on narratives and what we can learn about /what/ people say, /how/ they say it, what the writer/narrator's role is, and what stories tell us about ourselves. It should be pretty engaging/entertaining, so <a href="projects/AHS_Cap/btaratutin_AHS-Cap_StoriesAndWhatWeCanLearn_FINAL_FA2012_PDF.pdf" target="_blank">take a read</a></p>

                            <p>As part of a final project for a "Computational Complexity" course, two teammates and I did a bunch of research into how diseases spread through a network, how we can model this behavior through computer graphs, and how these networks respond to different parameters.</p>
		       <p>Besides writing up a <a href="projects/Epidemiology_Case_Study/Epidemiology_Case_Study.pdf" target="_blank">Case Study</a> on the topic, we also explored algorithms for identifying the most crucial nodes to remove, in case of an epidemic - to minimize the spread of disease, and included some of our findings in the case study - leaving still some work for the user to experiment & explore. <a href="projects/Epidemiology_Case_Study/Supporting Code.zip">Supporting bucket of code</a> (non-edited for release)</p>

			<p>My role was to develop all of the software control, UI, & algorithms - which involved controlling a laser to count photons emitted from these droplets, at 5,000 samples/second - to determine the fluorescent activity inside the droplet, and decide whether to actuate a micro-scale set of electrodes :P</p>
			<p>The platform was designed, built, tested, and shipped off to be used by Brandeis University PhD researchers, all in the span of two college semesters.</p>

			    <h4><a href="">Small-Scale Process for Making Charcoal from Maize Cobs</a><span>Spring 2010</span></h4>
			    <p>While I was away in Kenya, I developed a small-scale process for making charcoal from maize cobs - by combining the charcoal-making techniques/ideas from my friend James and the well-known <a href="http://d-lab.mit.edu/resources">MIT D-Lab charcoal-making process</a>.</p>
			    <p>There are a number of motivations for this project. First off, charcoal is a slower-burning, longer-lasting, generally mor valuable fuel source than firewood. Secondly, many people in Kenya cook inside (using firewood), which produces a great deal of smoke - which leads to health problems. Using charcoal is a great alternative (it burns smoke-less), but unfortunately charcoal is expensive. That's there the kicker (and point 3) comes in - where maize cobs are considered a 'waste' or useless byproduct - and this process can turn 'useless' maize cobs into a great fuel source! And because of the small scale (all you need is a tin can and already-existing cooking fire), almost anybody can do it!</p>

			    <p>Wikipedia topics are all related. We usually browse and read wikipedia one article at a time, but often we end up jumping from topic to topic based on our knowledge (or lack thereof) about their relatedness.</p>
			    <p>Now, what if there was a way to browse Wikipedia purely by these relational options? Ie. you pick a topic, type it in, and are shown the 5-15 most 'related' topics, and the description (read: 'first paragraph') of the topic you typed in - and can now explore the relationships of each topic - learning about many new things in the process. What if, then, you could also chart and visualize your progress in learning across the Wikipedia pages, and gain a visualization of the knowledge/topics you've explored (and the ones you haven't)? The possibilities are endless.</p>

Together, Alex and I designed and led a number of activities - ranging from working with clay, to tug-of-war competitions, to playing soccer and learning to use computers - to encourage local Kenyan kids in these areas and show them that they can do anything :D</p>
			    <p>In reality, this meant working with a fabulous, kind, and well-established community group (that Alex led), and going on trips to go play with kids every friday :D</p>

                            <p>As part of a semester-long Design for Manufacturing & Assembly (DFMA) class, learned about the end-to-end product design & manufacturing process; from business & marketing, to working with manufacturers in China, to shipping & distribution - and applied the lessons learned to make an end-to-end design for an RC speedboat.</p>
			<p>We performed a full DFMA analysis (minimizing assembly and manufacture complexity, cost, and time), spec'ed out a full BOM, specified the manufacturing methods, considered environmental impact, and specified a full quality plan, assembly instructions, and CAD package - everything you'd need to actually send this out to a manufacturer & have them build it.</p>

                            <p>As our group, 8-intern-wide summer project, we were told by our CEO, "start a solar company". So we did. Named "Solar Distinction", we worked with a manufacturer in China to prototype various 'designer' solar-panels, that would appeal to a higher-price point market.</p>
			<p>We designed, engineered, marketed, (and even sold!) a number of solar panels, some of which can be seen on the left. The top-left, "Kepler", is our basic "black-on-black" design; with black-binned cells, black-tape background, and black-anodized aluminum, you can slap it on a rooftop today, and not ruin the decor of your multi-million-dollar house.</p>
			<p>For the lower images, we experimented with covering the panels with various textures (even playing around with mica!) to make them more indistinguishable, and worked to develop some more 'out-there' panels, like the "Escher" modular honeycomb hexagonal panel, inspired by the natural and efficient look of bee honeycombs.</p>
			<p>We defined the brand, built the initial product line, developed prototypes, and made strides toward establishing a customer base - as a team of interns, over the course of a summer :p</p>

			<p>A partner and I analyzed the impact of food, transportation, housing, heating/cooling, electricity, and general "stuff" across three student 'types' ('high-impact', 'avg-impact', and 'lo-impact') to identify the categories of biggest environmental impact, and the best opportunities (strategies) for reduction of impact, and the student demographics that should be targeted - for maximum reduction.</p>

However, the machine that they designed, though ultimately assemblable with local components, requires a costly (~$500) one-time investment in a mold for the outer concrete shape.</p>
			    <p>Working off of an idea that someone else had for replacing the mold with buckets, Rodgers (a local Kenyan student) and I worked to develop a truly low-cost groundnut sheller that could be built entirely using local processes and materials. In the end, we managed to get the construction cost down to ~$12-$15 USD and the nut breakage down to 1 broken for every 10/11 whole (which meets/exceeds the 'industry' standard).</p>

We conducted a full-on ethnographic study, interviewed teachers, observed them, co-designed with them, and brainstormed & ideated like you wouldn't believe (sticky notes, literally, went flying).

                    <p>The 'Learning Link' enables teachers to quickly receive real-time information about students' comprehension during class. After explaining a concept, teachers can use the 'teacher link' to poll the students on their comprehension of that topic, and respond appropriately - by revisiting a topic, or helping individual confused students.</p>

                            <p>My partners and I conducted a materials science analysis on sugar glass, stage glass, and real glass - to see what exactly made sugar glass and stage glass safe alternatives to real glass. We also conducted context research to learn how, when, and whether each material is used in industry. </p>
                            <p>Then we made a kickass <a href="http://vimeo.com/9022229">movie</a></p>

                            <p>As a budding AP student and nerd in high school, I quickly became frustrated when attempting to study for AP tests - the study guides on the market were almost as long as the 1000+ page textbooks, emphasized nothing, and seemed to be written for people who never learned the material in the first place!</p>
                            <p>There was obviously a gap in study guides for students who had studied hard, yet didn't know what topics were important, and just needed a refresher of the main subjects and big picture concepts.</p>
                            <p>So I filled that gap and created my own 'uber outline' study guides, which I then marketed and sold to my classmates for a nominal fee. Now, instead of 1000+ page textbooks/reviews, you could get the major details of a subject in about 30.</p>
