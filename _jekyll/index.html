    <h1>Ideas and Tea</h1>
    <p>My name's Boris, I'm originally from Ukraine, live between California & Boston, and trying to make the most of life.</p>
    <p>For whatever reason, I have an inexplicable desire to share - everything that I know, have found, done, seen, experienced, discovered.. everything! My ultimate goal is to create a
        platform/method for sharing everything I possibly can - and this site is a first stab at that (a 'rough draft' of sorts). For now, this site is a little slice of my life: the
        things I've done, places I've been, and what I've learned in the process.</p>

    <h5>Why 'IdeasandTea'?</h5>
    <p>Probably the only two things that have been constant in the past four years of my life are my love for ideas, and my love for tea. Plus, why not? ;)
