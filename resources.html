                <p>Lists, downloads, links, and all the goodies you could never quite find in an infomercial!</p>
                <p>I've got links to cool sites I've found, lists of books that have blown my mind, and well-commented code examples for various languages. Poke around, hopefully you'll find something you like!</p>

                <h3>Mind-Blowing Books</h3>
                <p>In one way or another, each of these books changed the way I look at the world, and I believe are worth reading</p>
                          
                <ul>
                        <li><b>Count of Monte Cristo</b> <i>(Alexandre Dumas)</i>
                            <div>One of my all-time favorites! Dumas tells a very compelling and all-engrosing story, and by the end I came to respect the main character of Monte Cristo, who controls his emotions well, is patient, and knows pretty much everything.</div>
                            <div>The ending lines of the book: "There is neither happiness nor unhappiness in this world; there is only the comparison of one state with another. Only a man who has felt ultimate despair is capable of feeling ultimate bliss. It is necessary to have wished for death, Maximilien, in order to know how good it is to live. Live, then, and be happy, beloved children of my heart, and never forget that, until the day God deigns to reveal the future to man, the sum of all human wisdom will be contained in these two words: Wait and hope."</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Les Miserables</b> <i>(Victor Hugo)</i>
                            <div>Powerful story of Jean Valjean, an ex-convict who spent almost his entire life in prison for stealing bread to feed his children. An incredible story of transformation, justice, and redemption. It seems long, but once you start reading, it is utterly captivating.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Siddhartha</b> <i>(Hermann Hesse)</i>
                            <div>Fictional story of a man searching for the meaning/purpose of life, trying to find happiness. Asks the question: should one abstain from, indulge in, or simply accept the world around us? Short, quick, smooth, and through-provoking read.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Ishmael</b> <i>(Daniel Quinn)</i>
                            <div>Offers a completely different way of looking at the world and at our existence on it. A talking gorilla teaches a pupil about 'mother culture'. Personally, the biggest thing I got out of it was a completely new lens for viewing my existence on and interaction with the planet and everyone else on it. Pretty phenomenal.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Uncle Tom's Cabin</b> <i>(Harriet Beecher Stowe)</i>
                        <div>Tells a touching story about slavery in the U.S. Offers a pretty personal view of slavery and the life of slaves during that time in American history.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Fahrenheit 451</b> <i>(Ray Bradbury)</i>
                            <div>Set in a creepy futuristic city where firemen burn 'illegal' books, and where people live a mindless & bland life driven by their TV screens. Guy Montag, the main character is one of these firefighters, but ends up becoming an outlaw and joins up with other outcast 'scholars' who value knowledge and books. Very well written, and contains innumerable themes about our society.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>The Circuit</b> <i>(Francesco Jiminez)</i>
                            <div>Written in the perspective of Francesco, an illegal immigrant child from Mexico, about his + his family's life in "glorious, gold-paved California", and how their expectations did not match reality. It offers an insider perspective on how (illegal) immigrants feel about the U.S., why they want to come here, and what they have to go through. Personally, this book changed the way I think and feel about immigrants (legal and illegal).</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Mere Christianity</b> <i>(C. S. Lewis)</i>
                            <div>In his brilliant writing style, Lewis explores the idea of religion and whether it has any validity or backing for it, from a purely rational/moral level. He then talks a bit about Christianity. If you're wondering 'is there a God?' - it's worth a read.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>The Screwtape Letters</b> <i>(C. S. Lewis)</i>
                            <div>Framed through the eyes of a 'demon' writing letters to his senior uncle, asking for advice on how to tempt and win his human over to the bad side... the book offers a new way of looking at our moral </div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>The Good Earth</b> <i>(Pearl S. Buck)</i>
                            <div>A tad long & drawn out, but overall a compelling and emotional story about a poor farmer in China and his rise to fame and power. The farmer starts off the book chatting with the others about how rich and oppresive the wealthy are and how much he despises them. Over the book, through hard work and luck, he gains wealth, but in the process becomes the very figure he despised so vehemently before.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>The Omnivore's Dilemma</b> <i>(Michael Pollen)</i>
                            <div>A fascinating exposition about food in America, the ridiculous role that corn has played in everything, enormous monopolies & corporations, and the hard lives of the workers/immigrants whose lives are ruled by these industries. Absolutely fascinating; made me realize how much more goes on behind the scenes of our beautiful supermarket food collection.</div> 
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Myst: The book of Atrus</b> <i>(Rand and Robyn Miller)</i>
                            <div>Though not necessarily thought-provoking (it can be), but it paints a beautiful picture of a completely different world. If you want to get lost in a book and let your imagination wander, read this.</div> 
                        </li>
                        
                        <!-- ember? <li><b></b> <i>()</i> </li> -->
                </ul>
                
                
                <a name="movies"></a>
                <h3>Mind-Blowing Movies</h3>
                <p>Just like the books, these movies captivated my imagination and told a beautiful and thought-provoking story.</p>
                
                <ul>
                        <li><b>After the truth (Nichts als die Wahrheit)</b>
                            <div>The fictional case of Dr. Josef Mengele, the infamous "Death Angel of Aushwitz" - one of the most wanted Nazi war crimminals. Peter Rohm is ordered to defend Mengele in his trial, and experiences great internal conflict between his love for the legal system and duty, and defending a monster. However, as the story progresses and Mengele recounts his story, he throws a curveball at traditional morality and argues that he was, in fact, doing the Jews a favor. Mind-blowing in the sense that it offers a completely different perspective, and shows how differently people can think. Pretty powerful and phenomnenal.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Hotel Rwanda</b>
                            <div>"Once you find out what happened in Rwanda, you'll never forget." Recounts the incredible savagery and tragedy of the 1994 Rwandan genocides, and tells the true story of one man's brave stance against it. Paul Rusesbagina, a five-star-hotel manager watches his country descend into madness and feels stuck because seemingly nobody will intervene on the slaughter and genocide. So he takes action himself. Absolutely stunning performance, emotion, everything. Unbelievable movie.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>V for Vendetta</b>
                            <div>Set in the future, where England is ruled by dictator-like Chancellor Adam Sutler, who uses force and fear to run the nation. Censorship, curfews, "big brother"-like security, oppresion, art burning - the picture is vividly painted. Only a few will stand against it, one of whom is the movie's main character, "V". V dons a Fawkes mask and costume and sets off to wake the masses by destroying the symbols of their oppressors, literally and figuratively, in an unbelievably absorbing and captivating story ridden with emotion and epicness. Very cool and thought-provoking.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>The Terminal</b>
                            <div>Tom Hanks plays an Eastern European refugee, Viktor Vivorski, who gets stuck living in an airport terminal. Beautiful parallelism between the honest and helpful personality of an immigrant who remains cheerful and good-natured (even though he is living in an airport terminal), and the bureaucratic overseers who run the airport.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Life is Beautiful</b>
                            <div>A simultaneously hilarious and haunting comedy of the tragedy of the Holocaust. Guido, the main character and "madcap romatic", "wins the heart of his sweetheart, and raises adarling son in the shadow of fascism". "When the Nazis ship the men off to a concentration camp in the waning days of the war, Guido is determined to shelter his son from the evils around them and convinces him they're in an elaborate contest to win (of all things) a tank." It's good.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Shawshank Redemption</b>
                            <div>I personally can't stand long movies, but I didn't even realize this was one, until I looked up 2 hours later. An unbelievable story about patience, "the squeaky wheels of justice", and one man's (seemingly unjust) sojourn in prison. A prison drama that defies the conventions of the genre (violence, brutality, riots) to illustrate its theme of faith, friendship, and survival. Absolutely incredible. Words don't do it justice - just watch it.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Wall-E</b>
                            <div>A pretty revolutionary movie, since it is absolutely captivating, and the main character (a cute robot) barely speaks! Fun to watch, and has some fantastic themes about mankind's waste and laziness.</div>
                        </li>
                        
                        <li><b>Man on Fire</b>
                            <div>"Hard-drinking, burnt-out ex-CIA operative John Creasy has given up on life - until his friend Rayburn gets him a job as a bodyguard to nine-year-old Pita Ramos. Bit by bit, Creasy begins to reclaim his soul, but when Pita is kidnapped, Creasy unleashes a firestorm of apocalyptic vengeance against everyone responsible." A pretty emotional story of redemption and sacrifice.</div>
                        </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Audiobooks & Podcasts</h3>
                <p>Audiobooks are one of my favorite things on the planet. I've only recently started using them, but I'm already in love. I highly reccomend listening to audiobooks/podcasts while biking (like I did summer 2009, to and from work), driving, cleaning, or just for the heck of it.</p>

                    <li><b>The Day that turns your life around</b> <i>(Jim Rohn)</i> - motivation, inspiration, get-off-your-butt-and-do-it awesomeness. Explains/proves that any of us are capable of doing most anything, and then helps you figure out how to do it. Listened to its entirety while biking home from work one summer, and it revolutionized the way I approach my education, life, and work.</li>

                    <li><b>RadioLab</b> <i>(Jad Abumrad & Robert Krulwich)</i> - Phenomenal series that talks about interesting topics ranging from morality to how ants communicate. Jad and Robert do a great job finding interesting things to talk about and bringing in many professionals in the relevant field. Will expand your worldview and blow your mind.
